<p><strong>Hello! </strong></p>
<p>My name is <strong><em>Gagandeep Kaur</em></strong>. I am a Graphic Design student at BCIT.
This is my personal portfolio website where I share who I am, the creative skills I’m developing, and the projects I’ve been working on.</p>

<p>I have a strong interest in visual storytelling, layout design, typography, and branding. My journey as a designer began with exploring tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and now I’m also learning InDesign and color theory.</p>

<h2>This portfolio is a space to:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Learn more about me and my background.</li>
    <li>Explore my works, including class assignments and personal design projects.</li>
    <li>Get in touch with me for collaborations, feedback, or creative discussions.</li>

</ul>

<p><b><i>Thank you for visiting—I’m excited to share my growth as a designer with you!</i></b></p>
